# Bank Client Management System

## Overview
This C++ program simulates a basic Bank Client Management System, allowing the user to manage client records and perform transactions. The system offers various functionalities like viewing, adding, updating, and deleting clients, as well as performing transactions such as deposits and withdrawals.

The client information is stored in a text file (`Client.txt`) and includes the following details for each client:
- Account Number
- Pin Code
- Client Name
- Phone Number
- Account Balance

The system also supports viewing total balances of all clients and managing client accounts effectively.

## Features
- **Client Management:**
  - View a list of all clients.
  - Add a new client.
  - Update client details.
  - Delete a client from the system.
  - Find a specific client by their account number.

- Account Balance
